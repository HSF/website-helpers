# HSF website helpers

A collection of small scripts to update yaml/markdown files of [hsf.github.io](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/).

Currently there are two use cases:

* Updating the [list of training schools](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/Schools/events.html)
  using the `hsf-add-training-event.py` script.
* Updating [training community profiles](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/training/community.html)
  using the `hsf-update-training-profiles.py` script.

Run `script --help` to get more help.
